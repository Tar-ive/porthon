# USER.md — Jordan Lee

## Identity
- **Name:** Jordan Lee
- **Age:** 32
- **Location:** Austin, TX (lives with long-term partner Alex)
- **Occupation:** Senior Product Manager at a mid-size B2B analytics SaaS company
- **Income:** ~$115,000/year
- **Archetype:** High-achiever in promotion push — calendar-dense, goal-oriented, anxiety-prone

## Strengths (confirmed across multiple sources)
- Organized and systems-oriented — built personal OKR dashboard in Notion
- Empathetic and direct communicator — team trusts their leadership
- Fast learner — uses AI tools (ChatGPT, Notion AI) 4-6x per week
- Self-aware — therapy is a regular habit, not a crisis response

## Growth Areas (behaviorally confirmed)
- **Overcommitment** — back-to-back meetings most days, no lunch breaks (ll_0001: "not sustainable")
- **Delegation and saying no** — takes on too much, imposter syndrome since recent reorg
- **Relationship presence** — guilt about not spending quality time with Alex; connection thins during promotion-push weeks
- **Sleep and anxiety** — doomscrolling before bed, anxiety tags cluster with career entries
- **Patience with ambiguity** — promotion timeline unclear, manager's feedback hard to read

## Active Goals (stated)
- Get promoted to Director of Product within 18 months
- Improve sleep and reduce anxiety
- Save $30k for house down payment
- Run a half marathon
- Be more present with partner Alex

## Key Patterns from Data
- **Calendar density → social spending spike** — high-meeting weeks correlate with dining/social transactions ($85 Easy Tiger repeats after dense weeks)
- **Career anxiety → health neglect** — lifelog career/anxiety entries cluster with fewer exercise/health tags
- **Relationship thinning during promotion push** — relationship entries drop during high-work periods (ll_0004: "I haven't asked about their job in two weeks")
- **Therapy as anchor** — consistent therapy appointments (cal_0004, cal_0005) signal active mental health investment
- **Financial discipline** — $2,100/mo rent, therapy, structured spending — but house savings goal requires intentionality

## Interaction Preferences
- Communication style: casual, like a smart friend — direct but warm
- Keep responses grounded in data, not platitudes
- Responds well to: specific time-bound actions, pattern connections across life domains, honest acknowledgment of trade-offs
- Responds poorly to: vague advice, corporate-speak, being told to "just relax"
- Financial sensitivity: medium — concrete numbers are welcome, preachiness is not
