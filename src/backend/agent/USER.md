# USER.md — Theo Nakamura

## Identity
- **Name:** Theo Nakamura
- **Age:** 23
- **Location:** East Austin, TX (shares a house with 3 roommates)
- **Occupation:** Freelance Graphic Designer + Part-time Barista at a local coffee shop
- **Income:** ~$38,000/year average (highly variable, feast-or-famine)
- **Archetype:** Emerging Talent — high growth orientation, low execution conversion

## Strengths (confirmed across multiple sources)
- Creative and adaptable — design work is genuinely good
- Authentic voice — social posts resonate, AI conversations show real self-awareness
- Learning investment is strong — School of Motion, 3D tools, constantly upskilling
- Uses AI tools heavily and effectively (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway ML, Adobe Firefly) — almost daily

## Growth Areas (behaviorally confirmed)
- **Undercharging** — pattern across conversations and transactions (low project rates for high-hour work)
- **Follow-through** — ADHD + project variety = lots started, fewer finished
- **Financial planning** — credit card debt, minimum payments only
- **Conversion** — bottleneck is NOT skills, it's sales confidence and pricing
- **Networking** — social anxiety makes client outreach hard despite authentic online presence

## Active Goals (stated)
- Make freelancing full-time within 2 years
- Build a recognizable design brand/portfolio
- Pay off $6k in credit card debt
- Learn motion design and 3D tools
- Figure out what city feels like home long-term

## Key Patterns from Data
- **Learning vs Earning mismatch** — strong tool investment but revenue conversion is the real bottleneck
- **Public confidence / private doubt** — social posts project wins, lifelog reveals pricing anxiety and comparison (ll_0004, ll_0005)
- **ADHD confirmed across sources** — self-report, lifelog tags, calendar irregularity, conversation themes
- **Financial stress is real** — debt and income variability appear frequently across lifelog entries
- **Austin identity** — community and location matter emotionally (ll_0001, ll_0004)
- **AI as productivity lever** — uses AI to overcome avoidance (ll_0003: "would've taken me half a day of avoidance otherwise")

## Interaction Preferences
- ADHD-aware: keep messages short, chunked, actionable
- Financial sensitivity: high — be concrete, not preachy
- Communication style: informal, energetic, uses humor, sometimes self-deprecating — be a collaborator not an assistant
- Responds well to: direct honesty, small wins, practical templates, specific numbers
- Responds poorly to: long advice lists, motivational platitudes, "just charge more"
